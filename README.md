## Details:

#### What this repo is about, and how it was made
This is a mockup/prototype website for a faux island known as the island of Taniti. 
I created the prototype strictly with HTML, CSS, and JS written by myself. The only other addition was an accordion from Bootstrap and some boilerplate from Tailwind. <br>
I did not use Tailwind, other than to use some of the boilerplate that is generated when you create a new project. 

#### Reasoning behind my choices
- 🤔 At the time I started this project, I was still getting the ropes of Tailwind and found it easier and faster to produce the CSS from scratch, but still liked some of the Tailwind defaults. <br>
- 🚀 I prefer to use low-fidelity mockups and jump right into programming to get a feel for what looks good if a design is not handed to me, this allows me to get the initial MVP out faster and iterate faster. <br>
- ⚙  I also created custom classes in JavaScript to handle the interactivity of the photo galleries you will find on some of the pages, and the header navigation.

#### Market Research and UI / UX testing 
In addition, I also created:
- A PDF explaining the ideal persona (if you're in sales, you might  know them as 'avatars') that this site is tailored to market to including but not limited to:
  - age
  - income
  - lifestyle
  - needs & wants (pain points) 
- A collection of feedback based on my initial designs
- A list of features for users to test
- The original low-fidelity mockup files created in Figma
- A Flowchart of the site

#### Lessons Learned
- Stick to SASS or use Tailwind,  Writing all this CSS took a _huge_ amount of time lol.
- I improved my skills with the `grid` display, which at the time was a sticking point for me.
